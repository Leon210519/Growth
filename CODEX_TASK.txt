CODex Execution Task (English)

Objective:
- Use the repository root file PLAN.txt as the authoritative specification.
- Generate a new Unity 2022.3 LTS project for Android implementing the complete MVP Idle/Tycoon game as defined in PLAN.txt.

Branching & Commits:
- Create and work on a new branch: codex/idle-tycoon-mvp
- Do not remove or break any existing repository files or functions. Only add or extend.
- Commit in small, logical steps with clear messages, e.g.:
  - feat(core): add GameManager, TickService and SaveService
  - feat(ui): add MainScreen and UpgradeCardView prefabs
  - feat(economy): implement UpgradeService and IncomeService
  - chore(config): add RemoteConfig defaults and ScriptableObjects
  - test: add PlayMode/EditMode unit tests
  - docs: write README and release checklist
- Open a Pull Request to main with a short summary and checklist taken from PLAN.txt Acceptance Criteria.

Project Output:
- Scaffold directory structure under Assets/ as defined in PLAN.txt.
- Implement all scripts, ScriptableObjects, prefabs, scenes, tests, and docs.
- Ensure IL2CPP + ARM64 build compiles. Min SDK 24. Portrait orientation. Safe area respected.
- Include placeholder AdMob and IAP IDs in ScriptableObjects under Resources/Config (strings only).
- All unit tests must pass.
- Provide a short Docs/README.md with setup instructions (Firebase stubs, AdMob test ads, IAP sandbox).

Rules:
- Never delete or regress previously implemented features; only extend.
- Prefer additive changes to avoid conflicts.
- If any ambiguity exists, follow the exact defaults and formulas in PLAN.txt.
- Keep code in English, with XML doc comments for public APIs.

Deliverables:
- Branch codex/idle-tycoon-mvp with a compiling Unity project.
- Passing tests.
- Docs/README.md and Docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md updated.
